# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project aims to segment customers of a mall based on their demographic and spending behavior using K-means clustering. The analysis includes data visualization, data cleaning, and clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Mall_Customers.csv", containing information about customers including their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- gap-statistic

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn gap-statistic
```

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the script "mall_customer_segmentation.py" along with the dataset "Mall_Customers.csv".
3. Run the script using any Python IDE or execute it from the command line:

```
python YOUR_FILE_NAME.py
```

4. The script will perform data visualization, clustering, and display the results.

## Results

- Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Silhouette method is employed for cluster validation.
- Gap statistics is used to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualization of the clustering results using PCA.
